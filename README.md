# DESI-ML-Project

__Project Background__

Machine learning (ML) predictive models are sophisticated algorithms developed to forecast the values of target variables given discernible patterns detected within training data. Dimensionality reduction is the implementation of statistical modeling to simplify the complexity of datasets to their most significant features. Combining these two models allows us to consider how little information is required to predict desired attributes.

__Focus__

For the context of this project, we have a series of coefficients that describe the Dark Energy Survey Instrument (DESI) spectra calculated using various reduction methods. These coefficients are used in combination with two ML regression models give us sufficient information to predict physical characteristics of DESI galaxies. This work is relevant to future DESI spectral analysis, as there could be the need for a reliable methodology to quickly and accurately calculate estimates for galactic properties. 


Questions to consider:

  1. What number of PCA coefficients produces the best predictions?
  2. How do PCA and UMAP coefficients compare when it comes to predicting parameters?
  3. Which combination of coefficients and ML models produces the most accurate predictions?
